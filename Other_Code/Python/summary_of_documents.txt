The flip_flop.py is just a python implementation of the code. 
It is useful if you want to visualise the evolution of the simulation or
is you prefer to read python. 


The plotter_2.py is some plotting code. It plots the spin
current and spin accumulation on separate graphs with
the parameters summarised in a table at the bottom.
